import { ICON_PHOTOS } from './icon-photos.js'

// Original flat-color SVG word/picture icons used on choice buttons in
// place of plain Unicode emoji. Historically kept in the same
// geometric-primitive style as the character art in art.js (circles/rects/
// polygons, 2-3 flat colors, no gradients/photorealism).
//
// 2026-08 PROTOTYPE ROUND: the user asked for a move away from that
// abstract-icon look toward picture-book/word-card flashcard illustrations
// -- natural object silhouettes (a real key shape, a real leg with a knee)
// with mid-level detail and soft layered shading, not geometric shorthand.
// Ten icons (ant, corn, feet, fish, jug, mat, nose, sock, tap, top) were
// redrawn this round as a sample before committing the other ~60. Gradients
// and SVG filters stay banned either way; shading is faked the same way the
// character art fakes it -- overlapping flat-color fills (a darker patch
// clipped over a lighter body) rather than a `<linearGradient>`.
//
// ROUND 2 (same 2026-08 pass): of those ten, only `mat` and `sock` passed
// user review. The other eight (ant, corn, feet, fish, jug, nose, tap, top)
// were rejected as "silhouette barely changed, just shading added on top of
// the same shape" -- true of most of them on inspection. This round redrew
// those eight with the silhouette itself changed (new poses/proportions,
// not recolors), using web-searched reference for real-object proportions
// (ant's wasp-waist, corn's vertical kernel columns vs. a grid, a jug's
// bulbous belly, a faucet's thick gooseneck, a spinning top's disc-over-cone
// profile) -- see each icon's own comment for what specifically changed and
// why. Each was checked against a hard-cutout render and the same
// background-proximity metric described below before being kept.
//
// SIZE: these render at 200-261px on an option button (the exact figure is
// set by the option count and the device orientation, since the option grid
// became elastic) and at 150px in _art.html's gallery. This header used to
// say "~60px", which was true before the grid change and is what made
// earlier rounds draw detail too coarse. Judge every icon at 150px+.
//
// Two things decide whether an icon works, and neither is visible in the
// source. Its HARD CUTOUT (`filter: brightness(0)`) must not match another
// icon's -- greyscale is too forgiving, it leaves the internal linework in.
// And its own opaque area must not sink into the button: the metric is the
// share of the icon's opaque pixels within dE 12 of the background
// (`#fffdf4` normal, `#c8f5a8` selected). `sock` measured 72% once and was
// effectively invisible. Pale fills therefore always carry a dark contour.
//
// 2026-08 PHOTO-CROP ROUND (chapter 9-14 sound icons): the user licensed a
// set of phonics flashcard reference sheets (`icon_refs/*.png`, confirmed
// copyright-clear -- ours to crop and ship as-is, no redraw needed) and
// asked for the new Group 5-7 sound icons to be cropped straight from them
// instead of hand-redrawn as SVG. `ICON_PHOTOS` (`icon-photos.js`) holds
// each crop as a base64 PNG + its natural pixel size; `photoIcon()` below
// wraps it in an `<image>` so `wordIcon()` still returns one SVG markup
// string either way -- callers can't tell a hand-drawn icon from a photo
// crop apart. Base64 (not a `public/icons/*.png` URL reference) was chosen
// deliberately: this project's clipping/silhouette probes serialize icon
// markup into a standalone `data:image/svg+xml` URI and rasterize it to a
// canvas (see CLAUDE.md's "SVG를 데이터 URI로 파싱할 때" pitfalls) -- a
// `<image href="/icons/x.png">` would need a second network fetch with no
// reliable base URL once nested inside that data URI, while a base64 data
// URI is self-contained and decodes synchronously wherever the SVG ends up.
// The crops themselves are tightly trimmed to the illustration only (no
// flashcard letter/caption text) with the card's background flood-filled
// to transparent from the edges inward, so interior whites (a book's pages,
// a watch face) survive untouched. See `scripts/crop-icon-photos.py` for
// the crop tool if more flashcard icons get promoted later.
