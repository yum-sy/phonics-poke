// A single-letterform tile already embosses the grapheme inside the icon
// itself (see icons.js's letterTile), so a second plain-text copy of the
// same glyph underneath is visual noise, not reinforcement -- per the
// phonics team, two differently-styled renderings of one letterform at
// once risks undermining the single stable template a 5-year-old is
// trying to form. That reasoning is about the grapheme being ONE taught
// unit, not literally about character count: a digraph ("ai"/"oa", one
// sound spelled with two letters -- the project's first ones land in
// chapter 7) is exactly as much a single letterform as "S" is, so it gets
// the same treatment. Multi-letter tiles that spell a whole blended word
// (e.g. "SAT"/"TAS"/"ATS", 3+ letters) and picture-word options are a
// different thing -- testing whole-word reading, not one letterform -- and
// keep their visible label as before. The letter stays in the DOM as
// screen-reader-only text either way, for accessibility.
//
// `--label-len` is the length of the longest UNBREAKABLE run in the label,
// which is what CSS needs to fit the word to the card and cannot work out on
// its own (same reason .beat-equation is handed `--eq-len`). Measured on the
// longest run rather than the whole string because that is the run that
// actually cannot wrap: "octopus" and "umbrella" render 239px and 261px wide
// inside a 231px card today and print as "octopusumbrella" across the gap
// between two cards. Shrinking every label instead would cost the 258 short
// labels to save the 48 long ones, and letting the word break would print
// "umbrel/la" -- a false syllable boundary in front of a child who is being
// taught to read by sound.
// `veilUntilPicked` implements the "no reading your way to the answer"
// requirement: a picture option's spelled-out word label is the same text a
// literate 5-year-old can string-compare without ever listening to the
// sound, which defeats the whole point of a listen-and-discriminate round.
// Veiling only ever applies to picture icons (never letterTile -- see the
// block comment above this function for why those stay sr-only or fully
// visible on their own track).
//
// `choose` beats carrying `promptLetter` ("reversed" rounds: the target
// letter is shown on screen, find the matching picture) USED to be exempted
// here on the reasoning that the comparison is letter-shape-to-picture, not
// sound-to-picture, so the option label was "never the shortcut." That
// reasoning missed that the shortcut still exists in a different shape: a
// child can string-compare the visible `promptLetter` glyph against each
// option's visible spelling and pick by first-letter match alone, never
// once recalling "this letter sounds like X and X's word is spelled sun" --
// the exact sound<->letter<->word link the round exists to build. Veiling
// now applies uniformly to every `choose` beat regardless of promptLetter.
//
// wordspot-style beats (icon: 'letterTile', label.length > 2, e.g. "SAT")
// are unaffected regardless of the flag because they are gated on icon, not
// on length -- that round IS a reading task by design. `match-shape` beats
// (renderMatchShapeBeat) also call this unveiled on purpose -- those are a
// visual b/d-style shape discrimination, not a sound round, and speak only
// the letter's own name, so there is no phonics sound to leak either way.
// CSS (`.option-label-veiled`) hides it with opacity, not visibility/
// display/aria-hidden, so screen readers still announce it immediately --
// only sighted children get the "tap first" gate.

// SHADOW until the stage that character belongs to has actually been
// cleared, which also turns the roster into something the child uncovers by
// playing rather than a catalogue handed over up front.
//
// Keyed on isStageCleared, never on isStageUnlocked: "unlocked" means *you
// may play it* and is unconditionally true in dev, while "cleared" means
// *you have met this character* -- the only one of the two that says the art
// should be visible. So the reveal behaves identically in dev and in a

// the art review uses to judge silhouettes; the opacity term lands it as a

// ---- tap wiring ----
//
// Every control in the app is bound through here instead of straight
// addEventListener('click'). Two reasons, both about a 5-year-old's finger:
//
//  * `click` only fires if the press and the release land on the same
//    element within the browser's movement slop. A child who puts a finger
//    down and rolls it produces pointerdown/pointermove/pointerup with NO
//    click at all -- the button does nothing, which reads as a broken app
//    and gets hit harder. Acting on pointerdown makes the movement
//    afterwards irrelevant.
//  * `click` arrives on RELEASE. `touch-action: manipulation` (already set
//    in style.css) is what removes the historical 300ms double-tap wait, but
//    it cannot make the event fire before the finger lifts. pointerdown can.
//
// The app has no scrolling and no drag gestures (the one drag-ish beat,
// drag-build, is tap-to-place), so there is no gesture that acting on press
// could steal.
//
// `click` stays bound too, for the activations that never produce a pointer
// event: both harnesses drive the app with `el.click()`, and so do keyboard
// and assistive-tech activations. So the pointerdown+click PAIR from one
// touch has to be collapsed to one activation, and the suppression is keyed
// on POINTERUP, not on how long ago the pointerdown was. A window measured
// from pointerdown looked fine and was wrong: a child who holds a finger on
// a button for a second and then lifts produces its click *after* any
// plausible window, so the handler ran twice -- on a toggle (option select)
// that reads as the button not working at all. A click always follows its
// pointerup within a few ms, however long the press was, so pairing on the
// release is exact.
//
// It deliberately does NOT suppress a genuine second tap: that arrives as
// its own pointerdown and must reach the handler, because the double-tap
// defence lives in each beat's `settled` guard and swallowing taps here
// would leave those guards un-exercised (and untestable).

// a list of quiz steps: nothing in this app has ever consumed it to build a
// round. Chapters 1-8 already hand-author their own choose-sequence

// to STAY OFF for them and only supply the round chapter 9+ doesn't have to
// hand-author -- a future phonics author gets this for free as long as
// reviewTargets itself is right, which validateChapters already
// double-checks independently of anything below.
//
// Two gates, both required, so it can never touch what already shipped:
//   1. chapter.order > HAND_AUTHORED_MAX_CHAPTER_ORDER -- chapters 1-8 keep
//      exactly the beats they ship today, whatever this code would build.
//   2. the stage has no hand-authored `choose-sequence` beat already -- a
//      future chapter can still opt out per-stage by writing its own, and
//      this can never double up one stage's review round.
//
// Deliberately NOT wired into src/data/chapters/**: it reads reviewTargets

// ---- "odd one out" choose confirmation ----
//
// A handful of `choose` (and one `choose-sequence`) rounds ask for the
// option that does NOT share a sound with the others (majority share one
// sound, the minority pick is correct). This shape has no dedicated data
// field -- per the beat contract in CLAUDE.md, chapters 1-7 just phrase
// `instructionKo` a particular way -- so it's identified by matching that
// Korean prompt text (the only variants actually in use, confirmed via
// `grep -rn "다른 소리" src/data/chapters/*.js`). Real-play QA found the
// original `choose`-only gate missed the one `choose-sequence` beat sharing
// this exact phrasing (chapter 1's "moon" step) -- `instructionKo` lives on
// the beat regardless of kind (choose-sequence just appends "(n/m)" to the
// rendered copy, not to the stored string), so widening the kind check was
// the whole fix.
//
// A correct tap here used to fall straight into flashCorrect() and then
// whatever the beat does next (readAloud, or the very next beat) exactly
// like any other choose round. But nothing on screen ever names *why* the
// pick was right, so the sudden cut to unrelated content reads to a
// 5-year-old as "was that even right?" (reported from real play). The fix
// reuses redemonstrateOption's own mechanism (pulseHint + a spoken line)
// rather than inventing a new one.
//
// The spoken/displayed line is built only from the beat's own option data,
// never a hardcoded per-word phoneme -- these options are whole-word icons
// (dog/bus/cat/...), not letterTiles with a `say` sound notation, so there
// is no per-word phoneme in the data to name correctly. Guessing one from
// a word's first letter would risk teaching a wrong sound for a silent
// letter or an unusual spelling (see chapter-03's cat/key -- different
// first letters, same taught sound). So the line states the relationship
// the quiz is actually testing (this one is the odd one out; the rest
// share a sound) instead of naming the sound itself.
//
// Selected by the beat's own `oddOneOut: true` field (chapter data), not by
// matching the Korean instruction text -- the text is about to become
// language-dependent (KO→EN transition), and `validateChapters()` now
// enforces that any beat still phrased as the old "다른 소리… 찾아보세요"
// prompt carries the flag. NOTE: the `"{word}"와 같은 소리로 시작하는 걸
// 찾아보세요` beats are deliberately NOT odd-one-out: there the correct

// Tapping an option used to BE the answer. Two QA defects came out of that
// single tap doing two jobs at once:
//
//  * a child auditioning the board ("what does this one say?") answered by
//    accident, so rounds were won by luck and the stage ran past them;
//  * the tapped option's sound and the round's outcome fired together, so
//    tapping `sock` and then the correct `dog` played "sock" at the exact
//    moment `dog` was accepted (speakTap coalesces while an utterance is
//    still in flight, so `dog`'s own sound was the one dropped). The child
//    heard the wrong word as their right answer was taken.
//
// So the jobs are split: a tap SELECTS and speaks, `✓ Check` grades.
//
// Applied to ALL FOUR option-grid beat kinds -- choose, match-shape, every
// step of choose-sequence, and multiselect -- not only to the odd-one-out
// rounds QA pointed at. All four render the identical `.options-grid`, so a
// rule that held for some of them would leave the child working out per
// screen whether a tap auditions or answers, which is a worse problem than
// the one being fixed. choose-sequence is included despite being the
// rapid-fire drill for the same reason: it looks exactly like choose.
//
// drag-build is deliberately NOT changed: it already judges on completion
// with Undo as the escape, which is the same pick-then-commit shape arrived
// at from the other direction.
//
// The button reuses `.mic-btn` (green = go, and its :disabled is a plain
// opacity drop) rather than `.primary-btn`, whose :disabled state is the
// "audio is playing, wait" breathing animation -- wrong meaning for "nothing
// picked yet". `.confirm-btn` is on it so layout can take it over later.
